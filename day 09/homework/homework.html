    <p>The tradition of Halloween on 31 October comes from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. <br>Samhain was the Celtic New Year and they celebrated it on 1 November because that was the end of summer and harvest time (life) and the beginning of winter (death). It was also the time for ghosts to return to earth for a day.</p>
